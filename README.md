# Cobbler Hackathon

Sandbox Team: Cobblers (Ben Morey, Hayden Enloe, Kyler Cressall)

This is the backend functionality for our Sandbox hackathon submission. Primarily it will handle running the API's that the frontend app will use to fetch data from the database.

The server functionality is located in the root folder and the documentation (including sql statements, tables/ER Diagram, and additional notes) is located in the documentation folder
